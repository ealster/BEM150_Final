     We analyzed the NYC traffic data set. In order to simplify analysis, we only considered the 2013 data so the data set would be fixed.
  
```{r LoadData, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
     library("plyr")
     library("hexbin")
     df = read.csv("collisions.csv", header = TRUE, sep="\t")
     df = subset(df, year == 2013)
     df$lat = as.numeric(as.character(df$lat))
```

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6, cache=TRUE}
     scooter_accidents = subset(df, scooter == TRUE)
     plot(scooter_accidents$lon, scooter_accidents$lat)
```
Plot of bicycle accidents.

```{r}
     df_in = subset(df, lat < 44)
     bin = hexbin(df_in$lon, df_in$lat, xbin=75)
     plot(bin)
```
Accident frequency map!

Histogram of reason for accident vs total people killed.

```{r}
     reasons = df[,39:68]

     dataf = data.frame(matrix(nrow=4, ncol=30))
     colnames(dataf) <- reasons
     for (r in 1:ncol(reasons)) {
          reason = names(reasons)[[r]]
          reason_row = subset(df, reason==TRUE)
          ped = sum(reason_row[,"pedestr_killed"])
          pass = sum(reason_row[,"passengers_killed"])
          motor = sum(reason_row[,"motorists_killed"])
          cycle = sum(reason_row[,"cyclists_killed"])
          
          dataf$reason = c(ped, pass, motor, cycle)
     }

     barplot(as.matrix(dataf))
```
